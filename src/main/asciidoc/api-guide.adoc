[[overview]]
== Overview

The `HttpFS-Proxy` service is an authenticating proxy in front of a HttpFS/HDFS service. It offers a REST API for manipulating 
files on an HDFS filesystem, simplifying the underlying `webhdfs` API exposed from the `HttpFS`/`HDFS` service.

It acts as a gateway service (similarly to the what `HttpFS` does) i.e. it does not require that the client has network 
access to the Hadoop cluster.

[[authentication]]
== Authentication

The API authenticates incoming requests using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication[HTTP Basic Authentication] 
scheme. So, it expects an `Authorization` request header to be present in each request.

A simple example using `curl` and authenticating as user `someone` (proper headers will be added by `curl` because of the `-u` flag):
[source,bash]
----
curl -XGET -u someone -i 'https://httpfsproxy.example.net/files/status?path=temp/hello.txt'
----

Each proxy-level user maps to a Hadoop-level user, not necessarily with the same name. The proxy maintains the mapping between its users
and Hadoop-level users in order to be able to form proper requests to the underlying `webhdfs` API (e.g. for translating relative paths).

From now on, we will assume that all example requests are performed by a user `someone` mapping to a Hadoop-level user `user`.  


[[resources]]
== Resources

This section describes some common resources exchanged by the API.

[[resources-filestatus]]
=== File Status

An object that represents the status of a file/directory in a HDFS filesystem. Is the rough equivalent to the output 
of the `stat` command in a POSIX filesystem.

==== A request/response example

A typical request/response exhange is the following (note that, for this kind of request, 
`pathSuffix` will always be empty):
