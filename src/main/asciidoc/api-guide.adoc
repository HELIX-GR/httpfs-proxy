[[overview]]
== Overview

The `HttpFS-Proxy` service is an authenticating proxy in front of a HttpFS/HDFS service. It offers a REST API for manipulating 
files on an HDFS filesystem, simplifying the underlying `webhdfs` API exposed from the `HttpFS`/`HDFS` service.

It acts as a gateway service (similarly to the what `HttpFS` does) i.e. it does not require that the client has network 
access to the Hadoop cluster.

[[authentication]]
== Authentication

The API authenticates incoming requests using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication[HTTP Basic Authentication] 
scheme. So, it expects an `Authorization` request header to be present in each request.

A simple example using `curl` and authenticating as user `someone` (proper headers will be added by `curl` because of the `-u` flag):
[source,bash]
----
curl -XGET -u someone -i 'https://httpfsproxy.example.net/files/status?path=temp/hello.txt'
----

Each proxy-level user maps to a Hadoop-level user, not necessarily with the same name. The proxy maintains the mapping between its users
and Hadoop-level users in order to be able to form proper requests to the underlying `webhdfs` API (e.g. for translating relative paths).

From now on, we will assume that all example requests are performed by a user `someone` mapping to a Hadoop-level user `user`.  


[[resources]]
== Resources

This section describes some common resources exchanged by the API.

[[resources-filestatus]]
=== File Status

An object that represents the status of a file/directory in a HDFS filesystem. Is a rough equivalent to the output 
of the `stat` command in a POSIX filesystem.

[[files]]
== Files API

This is an overview of the files API. All API endpoints, except `/f/home-directory`, require a `path` request parameter.

If a `path` does not correspond to an existing file (or when a regular file is expected but a directory is given), the server responds 
with `404 Not Found` along with a detailed error message (as a JSON payload).

[[files-download]]
=== Download a file
This is a `GET` request to `/f/file/content`.

Because content can be quite large, this method supports compressed responses; it examines the `Accept-Encoding` request header and 
outputs compressed content (if, of course, is requested so). Currently, the only supported compression algorithm is `gzip`.

==== The request parameters
It accepts the following request parameters:
[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Parameter|Required|Description
|`+path+`|Yes|A user-relative or absolute path of a regular file
|`+length+`||The number of bytes to be returned
|`+offset+`||The starting byte position
|===

==== The response
The response always comes as generic binary content (i.e. content of MIME type `application/octet-stream`).

==== A request/response example
A typical request/response exhange is the following (file content not shown):
include::{snippets}/FilesControllerTests/testDownloadFile/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/FilesControllerTests/testDownloadFile/http-response.adoc[]

==== A request example with CURL
include::{snippets}/FilesControllerTests/testDownloadFile/curl-request.adoc[]

In order to reduce the size of the transfer, you can use the `--compressed` flag which will send the appropriate `Accept-Encoding: gzip` 
request header and will let the server switch to output compression.


[[files-mkdir]]
=== Create a directory
This is a `PUT` request to `/f/directory`.

This method will recursively create all parent directories (if needed so). 
If target directory already exists, it will do nothing and will report a success.

==== The request parameters
It accepts the following request parameters:
[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Parameter|Required|Description
|`+path+`|Yes|A user-relative or absolute path of a directory (to be created)
|`+permission+`||The octal permission for this directory (default is `775`)
|===

==== The response
On success, the server responds with `201 Created`, an empty body, and the `Location` header set to the status URI of the newly created directory.

==== A request/response example
A typical request/response exhange is the following:
include::{snippets}/FilesControllerTests/testCreateTempDirectory/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/FilesControllerTests/testCreateTempDirectory/http-response.adoc[]

[[files-upload]]
=== Upload a file
This is a `PUT` request to `/f/file/content`.

==== The request parameters
It accepts the following request parameters:
[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Parameter|Required|Description
|`+path+`|Yes|A user-relative or absolute path of a regular file (to be created or replaced)
|`+overwrite+`||A flag that indicates if an existing file should be replaced (default is `false`)
|`+replication+`||The replication factor
|`+permission+`||The octal permission for this file (default is `664`)
|===

==== The response
On success, the server responds with `201 Created`, an empty body, and the `Location` header set to the status URI of the newly created (or replaced) file.

==== A request/response example
A typical request/response exhange is the following:
include::{snippets}/FilesControllerTests/testUploadFileInTempDirectory/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/FilesControllerTests/testUploadFileInTempDirectory/http-response.adoc[]

==== A request example with CURL
include::{snippets}/FilesControllerTests/testUploadFileInTempDirectory/curl-request.adoc[]

For uploading real-world files, the recommended way is by using the `--upload-file <FILE>` switch (instead of supplying a `--data 'DATA'` switch). 

[[files-append]]
=== Append to a file
This is a `POST` request to `/f/file/content`. 

Note that a request header of `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` *must* be present to let the server know that the source of our data (to be appended)
comes from the request body (instead of <<files-concatenate,concatenating sources>> already present in the HDFS filesystem). 

==== The request parameters
It accepts the following request parameters:
[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Parameter|Required|Description
|`+path+`|Yes|A user-relative or absolute path of an existing regular file (to append content to)
|===

==== The response
On success, the server responds with `201 Created`, an empty body, and the `Location` header set to the status URI of the modified file.

==== A request/response example
A typical request/response exhange is the following:
include::{snippets}/FilesControllerTests/testAppendTextToFile/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/FilesControllerTests/testAppendTextToFile/http-response.adoc[]

==== A request example with CURL
include::{snippets}/FilesControllerTests/testAppendTextToFile/curl-request.adoc[]

For appending large amounts of data, the recommended way is using `--upload-file <FILE>` switch (instead of supplying a `--data 'DATA'` switch).


[[files-concatenate]]
=== Concatenate sources into a file
This is a `POST` request to `/f/file/content`. 

Note that (unlike the append scenario) the request body *must* be absent (and, of course, any relevant header of `Content-*` must also be absent).

==== The request parameters
It accepts the following request parameters:
[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Parameter|Required|Description
|`+path+`|Yes|A user-relative or absolute path of an existing regular file (the target file)
|`+sources+`|Yes|The list of comma-separated names of source files to be concatenated into the target file. These names must be plain file names and will be resolved relative to parent of the target file
|===

==== The response
On success, the server responds with `201 Created`, an empty body, and the `Location` header set to the status URI of the target file.

==== A request/response example
Let `hello-part.txt` and `goodbye-part.txt` be the source files to be concatenated into an existing target file `hello-goodbye.txt`. The source files are located in the same directory with the target file (this is a limitation from the underlying `HttpFS` operation).
